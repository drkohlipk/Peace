# Peace
This project was created during a weekly hack-a-thon for Coding Dojo's C#/ASP.NET stack.  It's a terminal-based game based on the card game War.  The rules are as follows:

1.) Each player is dealt half of the deck. The hand is not shown to the player.

2.) Both players draw and reveal the top card from their respective hands.

3.) Whichever player has the **LOWEST** value card takes both cards and adds them to the their hand.

4.) If both players have the SAME value card, then Peace Negotiations ensue.

5.) During Peace Negotiations, each player draws three facedown cards and each player chooses from one of the three facedown cards belonging to the other player.  The players then reveal the card chosen by the opposite player and whomever has the **LOWEST** value takes all the cards and adds them to their hand.

6.) Whomever collects all 52 cards, wins the game of Peace!  Except no one person wins... This is Peace after all, everybody wins!
